  title: Seven Samurai (Blu-ray)
  asin: B01DWKQG34
  description: Douglas sirk’s classic melodrama about An upper-class widow who falls in love with a much younger, down-to-earth nurseryman, much to the disapproval of her children and criticism of her country club peers. Criterion collection did a pretty spectacular job in preserving this highly accurate, vivid technicolor film. Finally a 2K resolution film transfer that does justice to these carefully framed, breathtaking shots.
