    <p class="excerpt">
      The last movie in Dick Tracy's film series, based on the comic strip character created by Chester Gould. It is another great 1940s crime B-film, while not extraordinary, still more remarkable than other low budget B-film noirs of its time. In this movie, probably the best of the four, Dick Tracy has to confront a villain using a nerve gas to rob banks. Boris Karloff is extremely creepy and charismatic as the main villain.

      He Walked By Night is a turning point in the film-noir detective movie genre, offering a more realistic look at police procedures.

    <p class="excerpt">
      Mostly known as the last British film Hitchcock made before leaving to Hollywood, Jamaica Inn is an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's 1936 novel of the same name.  Although considered to be one of Hitchcock's worst films, it is still certainly worth watching. Hitchcock captures quite vividly the dark atmosphere of the novel, and Charles Laughton acting as Squire Pengallon, the vicious head of a gang of smugglers is superb.
