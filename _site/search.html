   *   A function that should return the element that is

   *   resulting sort to occur on a parent or another
   *   associated element.

   *   E.g. $('td').sortElements(comparator, function(){

   *   The <td>'s parent (<tr>) will be sorted instead

      The last movie in Dick Tracy's film series, based on the comic strip character created by Chester Gould. It is another great 1940s crime B-film, while not extraordinary, still more remarkable than other low budget B-film noirs of its time. In this movie, probably the best of the four, Dick Tracy has to confront a villain using a nerve gas to rob banks. Boris Karloff is extremely creepy and charismatic as the main villain.

Although considered to be one of Hitchcock's worst films, it is still certainly worth watching. Hitchcock captures quite vividly the dark atmosphere of the novel, and Charles Laughton acting as Squire Pengallon, the vicious head of a gang of smugglers is superb.

    </h3>
    <p class="excerpt">
      Police is Chaplin's 14th film with Essanay Studios. It is one of his best Essanay's shorts, managing to tell a coherent story with strong elements of social commentary. Charlie is an ex-convict who finds life on the outside too hard to bear, can't find a decent job (or any job at all) and then decides to burglarize a house with another ex-convict.

    <p class="excerpt">
      The Knockout was Chaplin's 17th movie for Keystone Studios. Although more of a Fatty Arbuckle film, Chaplin has a small role as the boxing referee. Fatty Arbuckle wants to prove his girl how brave he is and challenges the boxing champion to a fight. A hilarious 1914 Keystone short film featuring romance, fraud, street fights and one of the funniest boxing matches in the history of cinema.
