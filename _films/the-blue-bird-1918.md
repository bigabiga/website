excerpt: Two peasant children are led by a fairy to search for the Blue Bird of Happiness. The fairy gives them a cap with a diamond setting, and when they turn the diamond, the children become aware of and conversant with the souls of a Dog and Cat, as well as of Fire, Water, Bread, Light, and other presumably inanimate things.
