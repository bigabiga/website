excerpt: Mostly known as the last British film Hitchcock made before leaving to Hollywood, Jamaica Inn is an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's 1936 novel of the same name.  Although considered to be one of Hitchcock's worst films, it is still certainly worth watching. Hitchcock captures quite vividly the dark atmosphere of the novel, and Charles Laughton acting as Squire Pengallon, the vicious head of a gang of smugglers is superb.
