excerpt: D.W. Griffith's epic tale of the American civil war, told primarily from the perspective of the South. The story is nominally that of two families, one from the north, the other the south, and the challenges they face during the war. Heavily slanted in favor of the Confederates, who are noble and right, against the Yankees who are degenerate and without scruples.
