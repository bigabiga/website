excerpt: This first of Jean Vigo's films takes up the then current "city" film genre and uses it as a critique of the idle rich and as a call to the working man to overturn this society. The contrast of these two "worlds" is followed by an exuberant street carnivale, where social conventions are cast aside and common people give in to their passions.
synopsis: This first of Jean Vigo's films takes up the then current "city" film genre and uses it as a critique of the idle rich and as a call to the working man to overturn this society. The 23-minute film begins with a section which visually introduces the subject, Nice, France. Then we see scenes of the idle rich along the Nice coast and enjoying spectator sports. Next follows visions of the common man, including street scenes, laundry being hung, and industrial images. The contrast of these two "worlds" is followed by an exuberant street carnivale, where social conventions are cast aside and common people give in to their passions.
