excerpt: The film takes place following WWII and with China brought to its knees by the actions of the Japanese, prior to the rise of the Communists led by Chairman Mao. Wei Wei plays a woman who lives a lonely life, shackled by her care for her gentle, but ill husband (Shi Yu)- that is until her first love reappears into her life. This is Fei's penultimate film as director, but is still enjoyed by many today as one of his best works.
