meta-title: Watch Kid Auto Races At Venice (1914)
meta-description: Kid Auto Races at Venice is Chaplin's Little Tramp first cinematic appearance and the second film Chaplin participated in.

excerpt: Kid Auto Races at Venice is Chaplin's Little Tramp first cinematic appearance and the second film Chaplin participated in. Less than a half a year before, Chaplin was an obscure British vaudeville actor, without the slightest idea about filmmaking. Those early movies have a tremendous historical value and can be seen as a portrait of young Hollywood and an extremely rare look at one of its biggest talents learning and perfecting his craft.
