excerpt: Charles-Émile Reynaud was the inventor of the animated cartoon. His 1892 short film, Pauvre Pierrot, consists of 500 individually painted images. Reynaud, a poor businessman, invented the Theatre Optique system that pushed pre-cinema technology as far as possible. He developed the Praxinoscope - a radical development of established animation toys such as the Zoetrope. He was also the first to use film perforations, that made it possible to display a much longer sequence of images. His short animated films visual beauty and novelty makes him an extremely unique and important figure in the history of cinema.
