meta-title: Watch Dick Tracy meets Gruesome (1947) Online
meta-description: The last movie in Dick Tracy's film series, and probably the best of the four. In this great B-film noir detective movie, Dick Tracy has to confront a villain using a nerve gas to rob banks.

excerpt: The last movie in Dick Tracy's film series, based on the comic strip character created by Chester Gould. It is another great 1940s crime B-film, while not extraordinary, still more remarkable than other low budget B-film noirs of its time. In this movie, probably the best of the four, Dick Tracy has to confront a villain using a nerve gas to rob banks. Boris Karloff is extremely creepy and charismatic as the main villain.
